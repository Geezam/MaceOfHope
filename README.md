**Mace of Hope** is a text-based, first-person dungeon crawler RPG written in Python.

Heavily inspired by the classic Game Boy title *The Sword of Hope* (1989), this project combines retro exploration mechanics with a modern, colorful console interface powered by the [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) library.

It is built upon the RPG battle engine developed in [SimpleRPG2](https://github.com/Geezam/SimpleRPG2).

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

* **Dynamic Stats:** Character stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Evasion) are calculated in real-time based on your class, level, and current gear.
